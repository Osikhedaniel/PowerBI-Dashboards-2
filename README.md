Welcome to my Power BI visualizations repository! This collection showcases dashboards and reports I have built over the past two years, highlighting my journey and growth in data visualization and analytics.

As time progressed, my understanding of data modeling, DAX calculations, and storytelling through visualizations has significantly improved. Early projects reflect my foundational learning, while more recent dashboards demonstrate advanced techniques, interactivity, and cleaner, more insightful designs.

This repository is not just a record of completed work—it is a reflection of my ongoing development as a data analyst and visualization developer. I continue to explore new features in Power BI, enhance my analytical skills, and refine my ability to turn complex datasets into meaningful insights.
